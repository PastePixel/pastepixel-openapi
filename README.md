# PastePixel OpenAPI 3 definition
In this repository you find the OpenAPI definition of the public PastePixel API. We have written our specification in
a YAML file. Feel free to download the YAML file and convert it to JSON if you want to use JSON.

For more information about the OpenAPI standard you can visit their [website](https://swagger.io/specification/).

## Usage
You can use the OpenAPI definition in either of the following ways:
- Import it to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Use an OpenAPI UI renderer to view the documentation (e.g. [Swagger-UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/))
